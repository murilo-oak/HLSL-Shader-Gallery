Welcome to the HLSL Shader Gallery, a showcase of meticulously crafted scenes that demonstrate the technical artistry behind shader programming. 

## Scene 1: Shaders for Game Devs Assignments 🎮

Explore a collection of shaders developed as assignments for the "Shaders for Game Devs" course. Immerse yourself in the world of shaders with implementations that include multiple lights and two health bar shaders. To learn more about this course and its assignments, refer to the course playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLImQaTpSAdsCnJon-Eir92SZMl7tPBS4Z).

## Scene 3: Grass Rendering with Tessellation 🌿

Step into a vibrant grassy landscape rendered using a geometry shader with tessellation. This scene presents a stylized representation of grass, showcasing the artistry of shader programming. Although shadows are not utilized, this implementation draws inspiration from the article [Grass Shader](https://roystan.net/articles/grass-shader/) and incorporates elements of the Subsurface Scattering effect described in the article [Fast Subsurface Scattering](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/08/30/fast-subsurface-scattering-1/).
